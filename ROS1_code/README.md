# LTL_CANOPIES_Synchronization_master_thesis
Master Thesis Project under the supervision of  Dimos Dimarogonas, Victor Nan, and Lefteris Vlahakis

The first part of the project is centered around developing an algorithm to synchronize agents under LTL specifications. This algorithm must be adapted to the settings of the CANOPIES project so the algorithm must include the possibility to include recurrent tasks.
The second part will be implementing the algorithm and testing its performance on the Turtlebots and Rosies lab robots. This second part will require the development of motion algorithms and controllers to perform collaborative action with 2 or more agents involved.
